# Card Sleight Animation 🃏✨

This project is a web-based interactive animation of a deck of cards. Using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it demonstrates how to create a draggable card interface where cards, when released, smoothly animate back into a randomized stack with an arc and spin effect.

## Demo 🚀

You can see a live demo of the animation in the `index.html` file. Just open it in your web browser!

## Features 🌟

- **Draggable Cards:** Click and drag individual cards within the deck container.
- **Smooth Animation:** When released, cards animate back to the stack with a natural-feeling arc trajectory and rotation.
- **Randomized Stacking:** Cards return to a slightly randomized position and rotation within the deck.
- **Pure Frontend:** Built entirely with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript – no external libraries required.
- **Responsive Design:** The basic layout adapts to different viewport sizes.
